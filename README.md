# ERP-system-BOOTSTRAP-GUI-Only
Very fluent BOOTSTRAP GUI template FOR ERP system. It includes dashboard, profile, list view, register, login and error page

Below are some points to be noted:

1- This GUI has been taken from BootStrap STUDIO but has been simplified such that it executes easily when you open an HTML file.

2- each HTML file opens easily without any changes required. It makes use of stuff present in ASSETS folder thus the "ASSETS" folder should not be deleted.

  
3- Take advantage of 'Reusibility Concept' and you can easily resuse the components present in each HTML file.
 
4- HTML is relatively easily to understand as its component based by the help of division tag. Each component has its own life and does not depend on other component.
